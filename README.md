## Analysis

Analysis regarding the degree and the number of monomials can be found in src/analysis_deg.py
Analysis regarding the nonlinearity can be found in src/analysis_nl/sage
NLUTs generation, filter block function and truth table generation can be found in src/gabriel.sage

## Notebook

In notebook.ipynb, you will find:
- The functions used to retrieve the values computed with the analysis
- The complexity formulas for nonlinearity, algebraic and number of monomials based attacks
- The functions used for computing the number of polyfunctions
